### Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure

1. **Create the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir FinanceApp
   cd FinanceApp
   ```

2. **Create Subdirectories:**
   ```bash
   mkdir backend frontend
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend with Flask

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install Flask Flask-Cors sqlite3
   ```

4. **Create the Backend Files:**
   - **app.py**: Main application file.
   - **db.py**: Database connection and initialization.
   - **test_api.py**: API testing script.

   You can use the code snippets you provided earlier for these files.

5. **Create the Database:**
   In `db.py`, ensure that the database and tables are created when the application starts.

6. **Run the Backend:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend with React Native

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Initialize a New React Native Project:**
   Make sure you have Node.js and React Native CLI installed. If not, install them first.
   ```bash
   npx react-native init FinanceApp
   cd FinanceApp
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**
   Update the `package.json` file with the necessary dependencies:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs": "^7.3.10",
       "@react-navigation/native": "^7.1.6",
       "@react-navigation/stack": "^7.2.10",
       "axios": "^1.9.0",
       "react-native-safe-area-context": "^5.4.0",
       "react-native-screens": "^4.10.0",
       "react-native-vector-icons": "^10.2.0"
     },
     "devDependencies": {
       "@babel/core": "^7.26.10",
       "@babel/preset-env": "^7.26.9",
       "@babel/preset-react": "^7.26.3",
       "strip-bom-cli": "^2.0.0"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Install the Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Set Up Navigation:**
   Create a basic navigation structure in your React Native app.

6. **Create Components:**
   Create components for adding expenses, viewing reports, and listing transactions.

### Step 4: Implement Features

1. **Backend Features:**
   - Implement API endpoints for adding expenses, adding income, listing transactions, and generating reports.
   - Use the provided code snippets to complete the API functionality in `app.py`.

2. **Frontend Features:**
   - Use Axios to connect to the Flask API.
   - Create forms for adding expenses and income.
   - Create views for listing expenses and income.
   - Implement a report view to show total expenses, income, and balance.

### Step 5: Testing

1. **Test the API:**
   Use the `test_api.py` script to ensure that your API endpoints are working correctly.

2. **Test the Frontend:**
   Run the React Native app on an emulator or physical device:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android  # For Android
   npx react-native run-ios      # For iOS
   ```

### Step 6: Deployment

1. **Deploy the Backend:**
   Consider deploying your Flask app using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

2. **Deploy the Frontend:**
   For React Native, you can build the app for Android and iOS and publish it to the respective app stores.
